This is my project named Planet Protectors. I have designed this website based on SDG 13, which focuses on Climate Action. The website contains a lot of content about SDG 13 and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and users can participate in various challenges to win a hero badge. Users can also test their knowledge on SDGs and SDG 13 by taking quizzes available on our website, with instant results provided. Additionally, users can join our community program by filling out the form available on the 'Join Us' page. This website is highly engaging.


To build this website I have used:  
  
  1) To build the Frontend I have used Javascript library React.

  2) To store user details and images, I utilized Firebase Storage and Firestore

  3) For authentication purposes, I also integrated Firebase.

  4) For Hosting purpose also I have used Firebase
